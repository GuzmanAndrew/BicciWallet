# BicciWallet

**BicciWallet** is a deliberately vulnerable banking-style microservices system built with Java Spring Boot. It simulates a digital wallet platform that allows users to register, log in, manage their accounts, and perform peer-to-peer transfers. This platform was designed **for educational purposes only**, with realistic security flaws that match the **OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Intentionally Vulnerable

This application contains intentional vulnerabilities such as:

- Broken authentication logic
- Object/property-level access flaws
- Excessive data exposure
- SSRF and insecure consumption of external APIs
- Missing or misconfigured headers
- Obsolete API versions that are still active

---

## üéØ Purpose

BicciWallet aims to:

- Educate developers about real-world API vulnerabilities
- Serve as a practical playground for red/blue team exercises
- Be used in YouTube demonstrations and workshops on secure coding and pentesting
- Highlight the consequences of misconfigurations and insecure coding

> BicciWallet is for **offline labs, demonstrations, and controlled environments only.**

| A02 | Broken Authentication                                   | ms-users            | Weak login validation, long-lived JWTs, no brute force protection          |
| A03 | Broken Object Property Level Authorization              | ms-users            | `/update-role` lets any user change roles without checks                   |
| A04 | Unrestricted Resource Consumption                       | ms-accounts, ms-transactions | No pagination limit in `/history/all`, account creation flood               |
| A05 | Broken Function Level Authorization                     | ms-users            | No role check in endpoint like `/delete-user`                              |
