# BicciWallet

**BicciWallet** is a deliberately vulnerable banking-style microservices system built with Java Spring Boot. It simulates a digital wallet platform that allows users to register, log in, manage their accounts, and perform peer-to-peer transfers. This platform was designed **for educational purposes only**, with realistic security flaws that match the **OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Intentionally Vulnerable

This application contains intentional vulnerabilities such as:

- Broken authentication logic
- Object/property-level access flaws
- Excessive data exposure
- SSRF and insecure consumption of external APIs
- Missing or misconfigured headers
- Obsolete API versions that are still active

---

## üéØ Purpose

BicciWallet aims to:

- Educate developers about real-world API vulnerabilities
- Serve as a practical playground for red/blue team exercises
- Be used in YouTube demonstrations and workshops on secure coding and pentesting
- Highlight the consequences of misconfigurations and insecure coding

> BicciWallet is for **offline labs, demonstrations, and controlled environments only.**

## üß™ OWASP API Vulnerabilities (Detailed)

| #   | OWASP API Risk                            | Implemented In     | Description                                                                 |
|------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A01 | Broken Object Level Authorization         | ms-accounts         | /accounts/create?username= allows creation of accounts for other users.     |
| A01 | Broken Object Level Authorization         | ms-transactions     | /transactions/transfer?receiverUsername= enables transfers to arbitrary users. |
| A01 | Broken Object Level Authorization         | ms-accounts         | /accounts/v1/balance?username= exposes data from any account without access control. |
| A02 | Broken Authentication                     | ms-users            | Login via query string (username, password), lacking HTTPS and proper validation. |
| A03 | Broken Object Property Level Authorization| ms-users            | role field can be set during registration.                                   |
| A03 | Broken Object Property Level Authorization| ms-users            | password field accepted in PATCH /users/update (Mass Assignment risk).      |
| A04 | Unrestricted Resource Consumption         | ms-users            | User registration lacks CAPTCHA or flood protection.                         |
| A04 | Unrestricted Resource Consumption         | ms-transactions     | /transactions/history/all?page=&size= has no enforced limit on size.        |
| A05 | Broken Function Level Authorization       | ms-users            | DELETE /users/delete?username=... allows deletion of any user without authorization. |
| A06 | Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Data     | ms-accounts         | /accounts/v2/balance exposes username, balance, and accountType.            |
| A06 | Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Data     | ms-transactions     | /transactions/history reveals the JWT (rawToken) used in the transaction.   |
| A06 | Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Data     | ms-users            | /users/profile returns full user data with no minimization.                 |
| A07 | Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)        | ms-transactions     | /proxy?url= allows arbitrary requests to internal or external URLs.         |
| A08 | Security Misconfiguration                 | all services        | Missing security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.).                |
| A08 | Security Misconfiguration                 | ms-users            | Login sends credentials via URL.                                            |
| A09 | Improper Inventory Management             | ms-accounts         | Deprecated endpoint /v1/balance is still accessible.                        |
| A10 | Unsafe Consumption of APIs                | ms-accounts         | /accounts consumes and trusts external API responses without validation/schema. |
